-------- Artistic Style ---------------
All code for this section are in A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style reimplementation.ipynb.
Since there is no provided EC for this project, we would like to propose the following to be considered as extra credit:
We took in a a result of artistic style transfered image as content image, and another oil painitng as the new style image, to show that when the neural network extract the content representation, 
the style of the image won't affect the final result. This result is also shown at the end of the section in the web page.
-------- Augmented Reality ---------------
All code for this section are in aug.py
use get_calibration_list(image points, world coordinates, generate_points=True/False, generate_rect=True/False) to retrieve camera calibration matrices
use generate_cube(frames, calibration_list, world coord) to place a cube at a provided point
Due to the size limitations of our submission, we cannot provide the original mp4. :(
-------- Video Augmentation ---------------
All code for this section are in VideoMagnification.ipnyb.
As for extra credit 3, we weren't entirely sure about what does "two additional set of parameters" entail, so we tried both new parameters (EC video 1,2,3) 
and different values for the parameters proposed in the paper (EC video 4,5,6)
